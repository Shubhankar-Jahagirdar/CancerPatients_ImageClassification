# CancerPatients_ImageClassification
- Image Classification of Cancer patients using Deep Convolutional Nueral Networks. 

- This project contains a ipynb python file and a pdf report. The python file explains in detail the code and the Machine Learning approach used to classify the colon cancer images. 

- In this project our objective is to develop a machine learning system that can classify histopathelogy images of colon cells. The dataset provided is “CRCHistoPhenotypes” dataset which consists of 27x27x3 RGB histopathalogy images of colon cells from 98 different patients.

- We have used the provided information to perfrom 2 main tasks:

- Classify images according to whether a given cell image represents a cancerous cells or not (isCancerous).

- To classify images according to cell-type, like fibroblast, inflammatory, epithelial or others.

- Based on this classification information obtained from the first task, we aim to imlpement the learnt knowledge of the supervised algorithm to improve the perfromance of the cell type classificaiton task.

- The data that has been provided consisits of histopathalogy images for 98 patients and the correct labels of isCancerous information of all image instances. However, the correct labels for cellType classification has been published only for 39 patients.

- In this project, we have used the supervised learning algorithm, Convolutional Nueral Networks to learn and extract features and perform the tasks with highest perfromance. The flow of the project follows an incremented approach with references and appendics as the inspiration to include the techniques in the performed tasks.

- The Jupyter Notebook file attached contains both narratives as well as the related Python 3.0 codes.
